         <h1>About</h1>
         <p>FAMSA Western Cape is a non-profit organisation (NPO) specialising in relationship counselling. We believe that</p>
         <p>“healthy families create healthy communities” and are the foundation of our society. Secure families provide a</p>
         <p>environment where family members can develop to their full potential, develop positive identities and form a set</p>
         <p>of values that serve as a frame of reference for life.Families come in many forms including: extended families,</p>
         <p>single parent families, gay couples (with or without children),nuclear families, child headed families, childless</p>
         <p>couples, cohabiting couples and combined families. FAMSA recognises all forms of family and strives to make a positive</p>
         <p>impact in our communities through our counselling and support services.</p>

        <h1>Community Services</h1>
       <p>The multifaceted challenges we face in South African communities, needs more than a simple quick fix. </p>
       <p>To drive real transformation, we need a multi-layered approach with many role-players. The surface-level</p> 
       <p>problems families encounter daily, stretch from lack of sufficient services to addre ss mental illness,</p>
       <p>disabilities, violence in the community and in the home (Gender Based Violence), criminal behaviour, unemployment, homelessness,</p>
       <p>addictions, chronic disease and isolation. </p>
